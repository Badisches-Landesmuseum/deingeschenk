  research project funded by the European Unionâ€™s Horizon 2020 research and
  innovation programme under grant agreement No 727040. It is a collaboration
  with IT University Copenhagen, University of Nottingham, University of
  Uppsala, Blast Theory, Next Game, the Europeana Foundation and Culture24.

** Getting Started

   This app is comprised of:

   - A frontend mobile web-app built with React in TypeScript
   - A backend API built with Koa.js in TypeScript utilizing a PostgreSQL DB

   For further details, see:

   - [[file:docs/core-concepts.org::*Concepts][Concepts]]
   - [[file:docs/schema.ts::type%20Id%20=%20string;][Schema]]
   - [[file:docs/device-targets.org::*Desktop][Targeted Devices]]

*** Requirements

    - Linux
    - NodeJS 12+ / Yarn
      (to build / run the project)
    - PostgreSQL (recommended) or SQLite3 database
      (to store user-generated gift data)
    - AWS S3 bucket
      (to store user-generated media assets)
    - FFmpeg 3.4+
      (to convert user-generated media assets to a common format)

*** Running locally

    API:
    #+begin_src bash
      cd api
      # Install dependencies
      yarn install
      # Setup default configuration
      cp example.env .env
      # Update config with custom values
      vi .env
      # Run the api (with verbose logging)
      export DEBUG='(DEBUG|INFO|WARN|ERROR):*'
      yarn start
    #+end_src

    APP:
    #+begin_src bash
      cd app
      # Install dependencies
      yarn install
      # Run the app
      yarn start-app
    #+end_src

    You should now be able to open http://localhost:8000 in your web browser to
    interact with your locally running gift app.

** Customisation

   Currently the code to run the app contains information specific to a demo
   museum, the Brighton Museum, and the Munch Museum. The following files /
   directories should be considered for customisation:

*** =/app/src/data.ts=

    High-level configuration for the museums. This is where the particular
    museum data used to run the current instance of the app is determined (by
    inspecting the domain the app is being served from).

*** =/app/src/services/prepared-data.ts=

    May be used to provide pre-made gift data in the app before falling back to
    an api lookup.

*** =/app/src/themes/global.ts=

    Global css theming.

*** =/app/src/components/background-svg.tsx=

    Provides switching of background image.

*** =/app/assets/audio-content/=

    Contains the audio assets used in the gift creation / receiving process.

*** =/app/src/components/audio-transcription/=

    Contains the text transcription for the audio files.

*** =/app/src/components/modals/terms-modal.tsx=

    Contains the text for the popup modal asking users to accept terms and
    conditions.

*** =/app/src/components/information/terms/=

    Contains copy for the terms-and-conditions / privacy.

*** =/app/src/components/information/help/=

    Contains copy for the help / FAQs.
